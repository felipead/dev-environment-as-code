Settings for Zsh using "Oh My Zsh"
==================================

I use [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh).

This script will install Oh My Zsh (if not already installed) and then install my settings.

Pre-Requisites:

* Unix-based operating system (Mac OS X or Linux).
* [Zsh](http://www.zsh.org) should be installed (v4.3.9 or more recent). If not pre-installed (`zsh --version` to confirm), check the following instruction here: [Installing ZSH](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH).
* `wget` should be installed.
* `git` should be installed.

There's a `install.sh` script in this folder. Just run it.
