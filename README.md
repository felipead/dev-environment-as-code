My development environment settings and dotfiles.

I'm a happy [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) user and I have no shame to admit it. A long time ago I was a heavy *GNU Emacs* user. After I started using Mac OS X I got frustrated with Emacs' lack of support for `⌘ ←`, `⌘ →`, `⌘ ↓` and `⌘ ↑` shortcuts ([Aquamacs](http://aquamacs.org) was also very ugly at that time).

One day I might still convert to Vim (or not).
