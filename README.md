My development environment settings and dotfiles

I'm a happy [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) user and I have no shame to admit it. A long time ago I was a heavy *GNU Emacs* user but then I started using Mac OS X I got frustrated with its lack of support for `⌘ ←`, `⌘ →`, `⌘ ↓` and `⌘ ↑` shortcuts (Aquamacs was also very ugly for my taste).

One day I might convert to Vim (or not).
